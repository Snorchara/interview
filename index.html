        <h1>Social Interview</h1>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Job interviews are exciting and anxiety-inducing at the very same time: Landing one means you’ve made it past the initial application stage and into the more exclusive “yes” pile, but it also means preparing for those all-too-familiar questions about your strengths, your weaknesses—yeah, you know the drill.
            But what if, halfway through your interview, the hiring manager surprised you with an unexpectedly interesting question—a fun interview question that energized you and got your creative juices flowing? The good news is that hiring managers really are asking questions like this in interviews today, and while they might catch you off-guard, they’ll also give you a chance to loosen up, and the interviewer a chance to learn more about the real you.
            So, take some time to think about the interview questions that you’ll actually enjoy answering, like the 36 real-life Qs we’ve gathered here from Glassdoor, Quora, Vault, and FlexJobs. We promise you’ll enjoy practicing your answers to these ones:</b>
